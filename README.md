Farmers often face challenges in predicting crop yield, scheduling irrigation, and monitoring 
soil health due to lack of accessible digital tools. 
The goal is to design a menu-driven Python program that assists farmers with key 
agricultural insights using simple data inputs.
This code asks the farmers to input what field they want to be assisted. Accordingly,it asks them questions and assists them.
